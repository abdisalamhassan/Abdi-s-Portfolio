    <p class="p1"> On Mach 20 2012 the Denver Broncos signed quarterback Peyton Manning to the team. A soon to be hall of famer and on the mount rushmore of QB's at the time. It was the start of a new chapter to an old book. Peyton spoke with the class and humility that is so so well-known for. He knew that all his past accoloades and accomplishments were just that; in the past. He had to now prove himself all over again. And that is the theme of my own coding journey..<a href="#More">More</a>  </p>
